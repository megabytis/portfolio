## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Minimalist & Dark**: A sleek dark mode theme using a curated palette of black, slate, and charcoal.
- **Performance-First**: Zero frameworks, zero bloat. Just pure, semantic HTML and optimized CSS.
- **Developer-Centric**: Features a code-like aesthetic, monospaced accents, and a clean layout that puts skills and projects front and center.
- **Interactive**: Subtle animations, glassmorphism effects, and a mouse-following spotlight interaction on project cards.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure and accessibility.
- **CSS3**: Custom properties (variables), Flexbox/Grid layouts, and hardware-accelerated animations.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Intersection Observers for scroll animations and dynamic DOM interactions.

## 🚀 Features

- **Hero Section**: Professional introduction with a gradient text effect.
- **Project Showcase**: Detailed cards with "spotlight" hover effects, tech stack pills, and outcome highlights.
- **Infinite Skills Marquee**: A smooth, auto-scrolling display of technical skills.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully fluid layout that adapts perfectly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- **Ambient Effects**: Subtle background grid and glowing accents to add depth without distraction.
